# Handheld-3D-Ultrasonic-Mapper
This project enables real-time 3D visualization of sensor data from an ESP32-based system using an MPU6050 (IMU sensor) and four HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. The ESP32 sends sensor data via WebSockets, and a Python script processes it for 3D visualization and Excel logging.
